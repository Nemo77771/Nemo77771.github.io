# Presentation on Replication Project

## Introduction
This presentation attempts to replicate a key figure from the paper *"How Can Lower-Income Countries Collect More Taxes? The Role of Technology, Tax Agents, and Politics"* by Oyebola Okunogbe and Gabriel Tourek. The focus is on understanding the dataset used to generate insights and the specific challenges faced in replicating the results.

## Straight dive into the dataset
The dataset contains key metrics on tax revenues in Lagos State, Nigeria, and spans multiple years, which enables a comprehensive view of tax performance over time. The specific figure replicated in this presentation is Figure 4 from the paper, which visually represents "Lagos total tax from digest in billions" over the years.

## Challenges

### Loading .dta Files (Encoding and Conversion Errors)
- **Issue**: Encountered an error when loading `.dta` files: `unable to convert string to the requested encoding`. This error blocked some files from being read directly into R.

### Replicating the Graph with Complete Year Labels
- **Issue**: The axis labels initially did not display each year from 1999 to 2012, which made the plot less detailed and difficult to interpret.

### Error Messages: "Zero-length variable name" and Unexpected Symbols
- **Issue**: Errors such as `"Error: attempt to use zero-length variable name"` and `"Error: unexpected symbol"` were triggered by spaces in column names, like `Lagos total tax from digest in billions`.

### GitHub Pages Site Display Issue (404 Error)
- **Issue**: Received a 404 error when attempting to access the GitHub Pages site due to the absence of an `index.html` file in the repository's root directory.
